# README for Developpers

Use Github project ?

Implement generalized cross sections computing in Compound (as of now, only total is implemented)

Implement derivatives

Multigroup cross section of Sigma_J -> Contribution of this J on the group

Multipole expansion -> how to fit it in the Compound class ?

kwargs cross section pass a list of energies

why U works only for LRF7 (Cu63) and X only with LRF3 (Pu9) ? 



## Problems
XS via U-matrix are not good at all, why ?
